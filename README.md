# Django Project

beginner-repo is an asynchronous, fully modular Discord bot framework that comes with batteries included, allowing you to write powerful Discord applications easily and quickly. It is intended for:

developers interested in an easy way to develop a powerful public or private Discord bot with a clean, readable, pythonic, persistent storage solution and easy-to-use caching
managers of Discord communities who want to automate tasks on Discord in a highly customizable way and/or without relying on external bots
beginner and intermediate level developers who are interested in asynchronous concurrency with Python using asyncio
any developer who's interested in trying something new and wants to give this project a chance!
Although discord-hero is easy to get started with, it comes with all the tools experienced developers enjoy using to build production-ready applications for communities, games or companies on Discord:

a Discord bot built on top of discord.py
You might think that with all these dependencies Discord Hero will perform badly, but so far that has actually not been the case at all! Continue reading if you want to give it a test run.
